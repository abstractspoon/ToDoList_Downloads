## ToDoList Downloads

This and all ToDoList_ repos are for the [ToDoList](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5371/ToDoList) task management / project management FOSS.

This repo contains optional ToDoList content, including spellcheck dictionaries and user content.

All pages are currently a Work In Progress, subject to rapid change and even to being moved.
That means any pages "missing" simply haven't been written yet and anything already written is going to get edited soon. Please have patience.

To find anything from files, issues, or documentation, or to report issues, please see [GettingHelp](../../../ToDoList_Wiki/wiki/GettingHelp) which has links to everywhere else.
